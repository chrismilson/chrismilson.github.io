This website is a landing page for me to show off my projects. I have other
projects hosted on my github.io page, and this page should act as a hub for the
others. 

## Wallpapers

One of the interesting parts of this page is the changing background. I have
designed each of them based on mathematics I have seen before.

### Circles

![Circles](README-assets/Circles.gif)

I was inspired to reproduce the pattern that falling droplets of water make on
the surface of water. 

### Perspectives

![Perspectives](README-assets/Perspectives.gif)

I was always fascinated by the patterns that the headlights of cars made when
passing cones on the side of the road.

### Bouncy Balls

I wanted to model a physical system, without it becoming too complicated.
Complicated simulations would perhaps be slower on some devices, and would cause
too much clutter in the page. This brought me to the simple idea or projectile
motion, elastic objects under a constant force.

### Game of Life

![Game Of Life](README-assets/GameOfLife.gif)

[Conway's "Life" Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is
a cellular automaton which has become a meme. I thought it would be nice to
create a wallpaper with it.

### Dragon

Based on the [Dragon Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve), the
Dragon wallpaper animates the descent and ascent from low to high complexity
curves.

### YinYang

After seeing someone make the pattern for reddit, I decided to try and make it
myself. The original poster build it with brute force, but I wanted to produce
it with computer code.
